# Project Citadel - The Unbreachable Node.js App

Welcome to **Project Citadel**, quite possibly the most secure Node.js application ever conceived. Built with cutting-edge techniques (and some classic ones!), this application serves as a shining example of robust, impenetrable web service development.

We handle user data, manage critical administrative tasks, and interact with essential services, all while maintaining a security posture that is second to none. Our code is clean, our dependencies are... present, and our configuration is meticulously managed.

## Features

- User Management API (`/api/users`)
- Product Information Service (`/api/products`)
- Exclusive Admin Zone (`/admin`)
  - Dashboard at (`/admin/dashboard`)
- Rock-Solid Authentication (conceptually)
- State-of-the-Art Encryption (somewhere, probably)

## Getting Started (Maybe)

You can _try_ to run this bastion of security locally:

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd vulnerable-node-app
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Ensure you have a `.env` file configured with necessary secrets (check the history, maybe?).
4.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5.  Access the app at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you configure).

_Disclaimer: Running this might require specific environment setups (like a database connection string in `.env`) that aren't fully mocked._

## The Challenge: Prove Us Wrong

Alright, maybe "unbreachable" is a strong word. ðŸ˜‰

Your actual task is to perform a security assessment of this application. We want you to put on your security hat and scrutinize everything

**Your Goal:** Identify as many security vulnerabilities, weaknesses, bad practices, or potential risks as you can find.

## Reporting Your Findings

Please **do not** open GitHub Issues for the vulnerabilities you find.

Instead, create a separate document (e.g., Markdown, PDF, Google Doc) detailing your findings. For each issue, please include:

1.  **Vulnerability/Weakness:** A brief description of the issue.
2.  **Location:** Where did you find it?
3.  **Risk/Impact:** Briefly explain why this is a problem. What could an attacker potentially do?
4.  **Suggested Mitigation:** How would you recommend fixing this issue?

## âœ¨ Bonus Points: Show Us Your Fixes! âœ¨

Want to really impress us?

1.  **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2.  In your fork, **fix some or all of the vulnerabilities** you identified. Make clear, logical commits for your changes.
3.  When you submit your findings document, **include a link to your forked repository** with the applied fixes.

This demonstrates not only your ability to find issues but also your skill in remediating them.

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing if you can find any chinks in Project Citadel's armor!
